\begin{proposition}
The word FEAR morphs into the word HOPE.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
First, by using rule 2, the letters in the word FEAR can be scrambled to form the word FARE.  Following this, rule 1 can be used to change the letter F in FARE to H to form the word HARE.  Rule 1 can be used again to change the word HARE to HAVE by changing the letter R in HARE to V.  With yet another use of rule 1, the letter A in HAVE can be changed to O to form the new word HOVE.  Finally, we can use rule 1 once more to change the word HOVE to HOPE by changing the letter V in HOVE to P in HOPE.  In summary, we have proved that
\begin{align*}
\text{FEAR}&\stackrel{\text{Rule 2}}{\longrightarrow}\text{FARE}\\
&\stackrel{\text{Rule 1}}{\longrightarrow}\text{HARE}\\
&\stackrel{\text{Rule 1}}{\longrightarrow}\text{HAVE}\\
&\stackrel{\text{Rule 1}}{\longrightarrow}\text{HOVE}\\
&\stackrel{\text{Rule 1}}{\longrightarrow}\text{HOPE}.
\end{align*}
In conclusion, the word FEAR morphs into the word HOPE.
\end{proof}
