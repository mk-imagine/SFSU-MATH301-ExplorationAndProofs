\begin{proposition}
If $n=ab$ for some $a,b\in \N_{\geq2}$, then $\Z_n$ does not satisfy Axiom 1.5.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Assume $n=ab$ for some $a,b\in \N_{\geq2}$.  It can be surmised that
\[
\begin{tabular}{ c c c c c }
$[a] \odot [b] = [n]$ & \hspace{1cm} & and & \hspace{1cm} & $[a] \odot [n] = [n]$,\\
\end{tabular}
\]
which can be followed by
\begin{align*}
[a] \odot [b] &= [a] \odot [n]\\
[b] &= [n].
\end{align*}
Notice, however, that $a>1$, $ab > b$ and $n > b > 1$, which, through the property of distinctness in Proposition 6.24(ii), means $[b] \neq [n]$.  Similarly, because of the symmetry of $ab$, $[a] \neq [n]$, which proves that Axiom 1.5 is not satisfied.
\end{proof}

\section{Revision}

\begin{proof}
Towards a contradiction\footnote{I did not make it clear that I was using contradiction to prove the proposition}, assume $n=ab$ for some $a,b\in \N_{\geq2}$ and $[a],[b],[0]\in\Z_n$\footnote{Also, I used $[n]$ to illustrate the equivalence class of $[0]$, but changed it to $[0]$ to give the proof more clarity}.  It can be surmised that
\[
\begin{tabular}{ c c c c c }
$[a] \odot [b] = [0]$ & \hspace{1cm} & and & \hspace{1cm} & $[a] \odot [0] = [0]$,\\
\end{tabular}
\]
which can be followed by
\begin{align*}
[a] \odot [b] &= [a] \odot [0]\\
[b] = &[0] = [n].
\end{align*}
Notice, however, that $a>1$, $ab > b$ and $n > b > 1$, which, through the property of distinctness in Proposition 6.24(ii), means $[b] \neq [n]$.  Similarly, because of the symmetry of $ab$, $[a] \neq [n]$, which proves that Axiom 1.5 is not satisfied.
\end{proof}
